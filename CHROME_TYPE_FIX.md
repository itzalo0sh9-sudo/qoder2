# Chrome Type Error Fix

## Issue Description
```
Please use type chrome instead undefined(2)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The error "Please use type chrome instead undefined(2)" is a TypeScript type checking error that occurs when:

1. TypeScript encounters a reference to the `chrome` object (typically used in Chrome extensions)
2. The TypeScript compiler cannot find proper type definitions for the `chrome` namespace
3. This causes TypeScript to treat `chrome` as `undefined`, leading to the error message

In this project, the error was occurring because:
- The project is a React frontend application, not a Chrome extension
- However, TypeScript was somehow expecting or encountering references to Chrome APIs
- No proper type definitions for Chrome APIs were available

## Solution Implemented

1. **Created a custom type declaration file** (`src/types/chrome.d.ts`):
   - Defined a minimal `chrome` namespace with common Chrome extension APIs
   - Declared the global `chrome` object
   - This provides just enough typing to satisfy TypeScript's type checker

2. **Updated TypeScript configuration** (`tsconfig.json`):
   - Added `"typeRoots"` to include our custom types directory
   - Ensured TypeScript looks in the right places for type definitions

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/types/chrome.d.ts` - New type declaration file
2. `frontend/tsconfig.json` - Updated to include custom type roots

## Why This Fixes the Issue

By providing TypeScript with a basic type definition for the `chrome` namespace, we:
- Prevent TypeScript from treating `chrome` as `undefined`
- Allow the type checker to properly validate code that might reference Chrome APIs
- Resolve the "Please use type chrome instead undefined(2)" error

This is a minimal solution that addresses the immediate error without adding unnecessary dependencies or complexity to the project.
