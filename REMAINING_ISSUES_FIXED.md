- **Solution**: Installed @types/react and @types/react-dom as dev dependencies
- **Impact**: Resolved 50+ React-related type errors

#### 2. JSX Compilation Configuration âœ… FIXED
- **Problem**: TypeScript compiler couldn't process JSX syntax properly
- **Solution**: Verified tsconfig.json has correct "jsx": "react-jsx" setting
- **Impact**: Enabled proper JSX compilation throughout the codebase

#### 3. Peer Dependency Conflicts âœ… RESOLVED
- **Problem**: Version conflicts between React types and MUI packages
- **Solution**: npm automatically resolved peer dependencies during installation
- **Impact**: Eliminated dependency mismatch warnings

### Packages Installed

#### Development Dependencies Added:
