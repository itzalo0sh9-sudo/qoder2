# Backend Issues Fixed - October 2025

## Summary of Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Missing Django Migrations ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Django apps in Finance and HR APIs had empty migrations directories with only `__init__.py` files
**Solution**: 
- Created proper initial migration files for all Django apps
- Added migration commands to Dockerfile for automatic migration on startup
- Ensured all models will be properly migrated when containers start

### 2. Inconsistent Migration Strategy ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: HR API Dockerfile runs migrations but Finance API does not
**Solution**:
- Updated Finance API Dockerfile to include migration command
- Standardized both Django services to automatically run migrations on startup

### 3. Alembic Migration Completeness ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Sales API Alembic initial migration was a placeholder with no actual schema creation
**Solution**:
- Updated Alembic migration to properly create all database tables
- Ensured SQLAlchemy models are correctly reflected in database schema

### 4. Docker Health Check Consistency ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Inconsistent health check endpoints across services
**Solution**:
- Standardized all Dockerfiles to use consistent health check patterns
- Added curl dependency to all services for health checks
- Ensured all services have proper health endpoints

### 5. Database Schema Initialization ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: No automatic database schema initialization
**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive migration files that will create all required tables
- Ensured proper foreign key relationships and constraints
- Added data initialization for core system functionality
