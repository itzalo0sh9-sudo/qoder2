# Frontend Src Issues - RESOLVED ✅

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 🔧 Authentication Token Consistency
**Problem**: Different services used inconsistent localStorage keys
- `notificationService.ts` used `'token'`
- `reportingService.ts` used `'token'` 
- Other services used `'accessToken'`

**Solution**: ✅ FIXED
- Standardized all services to use `'accessToken'`
- Consistent authentication across all API calls
- No more token mismatch errors

### 🔧 Missing Environment Configuration
**Problem**: No `.env` file for API endpoint configuration
- Hard-coded API URLs in services
- No environment-specific configuration
- Missing WebSocket endpoints

**Solution**: ✅ FIXED
- Created comprehensive `.env` file
- Added all API endpoints (Sales, Finance, HR)
- Added WebSocket configurations
- Added application version/environment settings

### 🔧 Redux Store Integration
**Problem**: Redux slices were created but not integrated
- customerSlice, productSlice, orderSlice were commented out
- State management not available to components
- Store only had auth slice active

**Solution**: ✅ FIXED
- Integrated all Redux slices into store
- Complete state management now available
- All business entities have proper state handling

### 🔧 Service Layer Architecture
**Problem**: No dedicated service classes for API operations
- API calls scattered in components
- No consistent error handling
- Missing type safety for API responses

**Solution**: ✅ FIXED
- Created `customerService.ts` - Complete customer CRUD
- Created `productService.ts` - Product management with inventory
- Created `orderService.ts` - Order processing and status management
- Type-safe interfaces and consistent error handling
